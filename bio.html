          <h2>Starting my journey</h2>
          <p class="main-content">
            Growing up I had a large amount of exposure to computers as I’m sure most kids at my age did
            around that time. I have fond memories of playing computer games such as Heart of darkness and
            the Tomb Raider series, as such I have developed an interest in
            anything computer related through the exposure to video games and PC gaming at a young age.
          </p>
          <p class="main-content">
            As such when given the option I chose to study subjects such as ICT at GCSE and then computing at A-level.
            This has then lead me to where I ‘am now which is studying Computer network engineering at
            Northampton University with the hopes of eventually finding a job in the computing industry.
          </p>
          <p class="main-content">
            In my free time, I simply like to catch up with friends although I hope to one
            day try my hand at animation which if it turns out to be a good fit I may take
            up as a hobby
